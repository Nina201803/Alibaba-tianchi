#About Repo

This repository mainly records in the process of the Alibaba Tianchi competitions, it contains two competitons. The repository is only for learn to study, without any commercial use. 

At present, they both enter the second season, it is a pity that I did not get a good rank from the competitons and I did not do it later. But I learned a lot from them. Thanks to Alibaba for providing this platform.

Of course, there are many mistakes and shortcomings, we can learn and progress together, thank you!
